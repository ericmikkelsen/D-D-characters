### Finding Seans Character

What I told Sean's character,

This is what I saw when I cast the runes right before meeting you.

#### ᚨ Os, Language or mouth

It meant that something weird and alien was about to arrive, but with hard work, patience, and determination, it could increase our knowledge, safety, those that we count friends. If it's handled poorly the exact opposite could happen. And it would be up to both sides to handle it well.

#### ᚸ Gyfu

Someone would be freed, and it would be good, but it would also mean that there will be a departure and an ending. If everyone involved handles it gently and wisely, all involved will grow.

#### ᛜ Ing Torch

A fire in a cold summer night, warms weary travelers, but a fire in Dragon's Teeth saves lives at night. Those that are close will be joined, those that can bear to be joined, will be, and those that cannot join will be hewn from life.

### What I said about your family when you were old enough to talk

I am dozer your caretaker, I found you and your parents were already dead, I had nothing to do with that. But you aren not an orphan, you are _FirstName_ of _lastname or place_ and I'll insure what is yours, is yours. Until you can defend it yourself. These are the people you came from. This is where your parents are buried. This place belongs to you and you are not an orphan. I am simply your caretaker.

### What I've done on the side

Also I've made sure that whatever government institutions that exist to say "this is owned by this person" know that house belongs to Sean's character

### Rune casting

#### ᚢ Uruz Or Ur - power

Personal power comes from within, but when the universe provides it, it  comes in the form of opportunity, but that will mean change. This will be a good time to take risks, as they are opportunities in disguise

#### ᚾ Nyd - caution

The path to power is mired by a fog of choices, be careful to take the right path. Although this is not a time to sit down, it is a time to think first then act.

#### ᛏ Tyr - warrior upside down

Tyr re-enforces Ur, but being upside down re-enforces Nyd, There is a storm coming, But with careful thought, and clear sight you can exit the storm stronger than when you entered it.
